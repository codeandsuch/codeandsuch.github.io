This small tutorial will show you how to set up [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) aliases for your [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) project.

## The problem

Importing files with relative paths is fine in small projects, but once the project starts growing it can become a burden. Many of us have found ourselves writing something like this in the past:

```js
import Foo from '../../../../components/Foo'
```

This not only requires one to figure out what the path should be, but is also very likely to break if (when) files get moved around.

## Webpack to the rescue!

To solve this, Webpack provides users with [resolve.alias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias) which allows for concise and consistent file imports.

Assuming our `components` folder live inside a root-level `src` folder, we can create a `Components` alias like so:

#### ðŸ“„ webpack.config.js
```js
var path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      Components: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/components/')
    }
  }
}
```

We can now refactor the above import in a way that is much cleaner and that doesn't depend on the file's location relative to `Foo`.

```js
import Foo from 'Components/Foo'
```

## With Typescript

This is all great, but in order to make this work with Typescript, a final step is required. At the moment, our alias isn't known by Typescript and will thus produce an error when referenced. To fix this, add the alias to `tsconfig.json`.

#### ðŸ“„ tsconfig.json

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "paths": {
      "Components/*": [ "./src/components/*" ]
    }
  }
}
```

## With Jest

Using aliases for commonly accessed paths creates a good workflow to build your app with, and you probably want to keep using these aliases when writing tests. So far, we've added the `components` alias to `webpack.config.js` and `tsconfig.json`, but since the Typescript inside our Jest tests isn't part of the same transpilation step as the rest of our codebase, the alias also needs to be added to our Jest configuration.

Unless specified otherwise, Jest is configured inside `package.json`. To make Jest aware of our `components` alias, add it to `moduleNameMapper`.

#### ðŸ“„ package.json
```json
{
  // ...
  "jest": {
    // ...
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "^Components/(.*)": "<rootDir>/src/components/$1"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: This assumes that you've already set up Jest correctly in your React/Typescript project.

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Our Webpack alias should now also work inside Jest tests.
